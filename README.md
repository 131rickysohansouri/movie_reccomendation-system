## Overview

Filtering and predicting only the movies that a matching user is most likely to wish to see is the main objective of movie recommendation systems. The data about the movies is used by the machine learning algorithms for these recommendation systems to create tags and discover similarities between films.

To assist users in finding the most pertinent films, movie recommendation systems employ a variety of filtration techniques and algorithms. The content-based filtering and collaborative filtering systems subcategories of the ML algorithms used for movie recommendations are the most well-liked ones.

This project uses content based filtering.A filtration strategy for movie recommendation systems, which uses the data provided about the items (movies). This data plays a crucial role here and is extracted from only one user. An ML algorithm used for this strategy recommends motion pictures that are similar to the userâ€™s preferences in the past. Therefore, the similarity in content-based filtering is generated by the data about the past film selections and likes by only one user.
